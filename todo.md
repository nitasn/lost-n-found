1. restrict google maps-api-key to my domain only

2. share button (on post-page) doesn't work on web

3. actually build custom uncontrolled input: styled, with x (clear) button, and with forward ref to read its value. 
   and with a way to set the value

4. map on web has many issues: pin animation state, map's not moving, doesn't goto current location on load
