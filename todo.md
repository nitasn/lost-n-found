1. restrict google maps-api-key to my domain only, 
  and also restrict actions (e.g. no street view)

2. share button (on post-page) doesn't work on web

3. rewrite location picker to include input text (and prompt for location permissions)
   also the zoom must persist

4. use uncontrolled input for the search thingy, it's slow rn
