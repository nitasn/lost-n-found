1. restrict google maps-api-key to my domain only

2. share button (on post-page) doesn't work on web

3. use uncontrolled input for the item description, it's slow rn
4. actually build custom input: styled, with x (clear) button, and with forward ref to read its value. 
   and with a way to set the value

5. map on web has many issues: pin animation state, map's not moving, doesn't goto current location on load
