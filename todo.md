1. restrict google maps-api-key to my domain only

2. share button (on post-page) doesn't work on web

3. actually build custom uncontrolled input: styled, with x (clear) button, and with forward ref to read its value. 
   and with a way to set the value

4. map on web has many issues: pin animation state, map's not moving, doesn't goto current location on load

5. on search, if there are no items, even if a filter is applied, 
   it should say `there are no items </3`

6. the picUrls of a post should have 2 versions (high & low quality)
   low for FeedPost, high for PostPage

7. the way auth is being exported is inconsistent. use getAuth everywhere...?
